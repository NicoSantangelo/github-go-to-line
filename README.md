### What ?

Free and open-source Google Chrome extension which emulates the _go to line number_ right into GitHub.
If you ever wanted to find a particular line of code in a GitHub diff and grew frustrated because it refuses to find line numbers, this is for you.

It uses the "de facto" shortcut to spawn the line number modal <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>.


If you have suggestions or problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/github-go-to-line/issues/).
