![](https://i.imgur.com/HlDcnX2.gif)

Free and open-source Google Chrome extension which emulates the _go to line_ from other software right into Github.
If you ever wanted to find a particular line of code in a Github diff and grew frustrated because refuses to find line numbers, this is for you.

It uses the "the facto" shortcut to spawn the line number modal <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>.
